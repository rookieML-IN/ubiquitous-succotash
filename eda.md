Trimmed Mean:
    1. Calculated by dropping a fixed number of sorted values at each end, and
    then taking an average of the remaining values.
    2. Eliminates the influence of extreme values.

Weighted Mean:
    1. Calculated by multiplying each data value 'xi' by a weight 'wi' and dividing their sum of the weights.

Visualizations for NUmeric Data: Box Plots, Violin Plots, and Histograms.

The Standard Deviation is always greater than the Mean Absolute Deviation, which itself is greater than the Median Absolute Deviation.

A common measurement of variability is the difference between the 25th and 75th percentile - IQR.

Standard Deviation and Variance is sensitive to outliers.

Percentiles are valuable to summarize the tails (outer range) of the distribution. They summarize by creating bins. 

Quartiles and Deciles wil have the same count in each bin (equal-count bins), but the bin sizes will be different. The frequency table, by contrast, will have different counts in the bins (equal-size bins). 

Histogram is a way to visualize a requency table.

Location, Variability, Skewness and Kurtosis as known as First, Second, Third and Fourth moments of the distribution respectively.

Desity Plotcan be thought of as a smoothed histogram. Computed directly from the data through a Kernal Density Estimate (KDE). It corresponds to plotting the histogram as a proportion rather than counts. 

When the categories can be associated with a numeric value, this gives an average value based on a category's probability of occurence. Expected Value (EV), is a form a weighted mean in which the weights are probabilities.
EV is calculated as follows:
    1. Multiply each outcome by probability of occuring.
    2. Sum these values.
EV is a fundamental concept in business valuation and capital budgeting.

The categories on the x-axis of the bar chart are not ordered.

Correlation Coefficient: A metric that measures the extent to which numeric variables are associated with one another (-1 to +1)

Correlation Matrix: A table where the variables are shown on both rows and columns, and the cell values are the correlations between the variables.

To compute Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient, we multiply deviations from the mean for variable 1 times those for variable 2, and divide by the product of the standard deviations.
